# Heart-disease-prediction-using-logistic-regression

This project is a machine learning model that predicts the risk of heart disease using the Framingham Heart Study Dataset. The model is built with Logistic Regression, a statistical method well-suited for binary classification problems such as predicting the presence or absence of heart disease

##Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from the Framingham Heart Study, a well-known longitudinal study that explores the epidemiology of cardiovascular disease. The dataset includes:

Features: Age, gender, cholesterol levels, smoking status, blood pressure, diabetes status, BMI, etc.
Target Variable: Whether the individual developed heart disease (binary: 0 = No, 1 = Yes).
